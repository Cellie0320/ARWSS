# Automated Robotic Waste Sorting System (ARWSS) Maintenance Plan

## 1. Introduction
This maintenance plan outlines the procedures, responsibilities, and schedules for maintaining the Automated Robotic Waste Sorting System (ARWSS), with a specific focus on the robotic arm provided by the campus. The goal is to ensure the continuous and optimal operation of the system, including all hardware and software components.

## 2. Maintenance Objectives

- Maximize Uptime: Ensure the ARWSS operates without interruption by minimizing downtime through preventive maintenance.
- Ensure Safety: Maintain a safe working environment by adhering to safety protocols during maintenance activities.
- Optimize Performance: Regularly update and refine system components to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.


## 3. Maintenance Roles and Responsibilities

### Project Team
- Basic Maintenance: Perform regular inspections, cleaning, and minor repairs of the robotic arm and other system components.
- Software Maintenance: Update software, perform bug fixes, and implement enhancements as needed.
- Monitoring: Continuously monitor system performance and report any issues to the campus maintenance team.
- Documentation: Keep detailed records of all maintenance activities and share them with the campus staff.

## 4. Maintenance Activities

### 4.1 Preventive Maintenanc
Preventive maintenance involves regular, scheduled activities to prevent potential failures and extend the life of the system components.

- Frequency: Monthly or as needed
- Activities:
  - Inspect the robotic arm simulation.
  - Test the robotic arm’s sensors(Vision and Proximity) and grippers.
  - Update the system software and firmware.
  - Back up system data and configuration files.
  - Review and update the campus-provided maintenance logs.

### 4.2 Corrective Maintenance
Corrective maintenance is performed in response to an identified issue or malfunction.

- Trigger: Upon identification of an issue or notification by the system monitoring tools.
- Activities:
  - Diagnose and troubleshoot the problem.
  - Perform minor repairs or escalate major issues to the campus maintenance team.
  - Test the system after repairs to ensure the issue has been resolved.
  - Document the problem, repair process, and outcome.

### 4.3 Adaptive and Perfective Maintenance
Adaptive and perfective maintenance focuses on making improvements and adjustments to the system to meet changing requirements or improve performance.

- Frequency: As needed
- Activities:
  - Implement software updates to enhance functionality or security.
  - Adjust system settings based on performance data.
  - Collaborate with campus staff to perform any necessary upgrades to the robotic arm.
  - Document changes and communicate them to all stakeholders.

## 5. Maintenance Schedules

- Daily Checks: Basic system health checks, including visual inspections and monitoring software alerts.
- Weekly Maintenance: Data backups, minor software updates, and performance reviews.
- Monthly Maintenance: Comprehensive preventive maintenance as detailed above.
- As-Needed Maintenance: Corrective and adaptive maintenance tasks triggered by specific events.

## 6. Reporting and Documentation

All maintenance activities, whether preventive, corrective, or adaptive, must be documented in detail. Reports should include:

- Date and Time: When the maintenance was performed.
- Personnel: Who performed the maintenance.
- Activity Description: What was done, including tools and resources used.
- Findings: Any issues discovered during maintenance.
- Actions Taken: Repairs or adjustments made.
- Recommendations: Suggestions for future maintenance or improvements.
- Next Steps: Any follow-up actions required.

### Reporting to Campus Maintenance Team
For any significant maintenance activities involving the robotic arm, reports should be shared with the campus maintenance team to ensure they are aware of the system’s status and any potential issues.


## 7. Training and Knowledge Transfer

### Ongoing Training
Regularly update training materials and conduct refresher sessions as needed.

## 8. Contingency Planning

### Backup Systems
- Redundancy: Implement redundancy where possible to minimize the impact of a robotic arm failure on the overall system.
- Backup Data: Regularly back up all system configurations and critical data to allow for quick recovery in case of a failure.

### Escalation Procedures
- Emergency Response: Develop an emergency response plan for critical failures that could affect project deadlines.

## 10. Conclusion

This maintenance plan is designed to ensure the ARWSS remains operational and effective throughout its lifecycle. By coordinating closely with the maintenance team and adhering to the outlined schedules and procedures, the project team will be able to maintain the system in optimal condition, mitigate potential risks, and address issues promptly.
