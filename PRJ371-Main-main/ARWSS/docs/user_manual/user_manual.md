## Operating Guide

### Starting the System
1. **Turn on** the power supply for the system.
2. **Initialize the System**: Start the control software on the microcontroller and wait for the system to finish its initialization routine.

### Sorting Process
1. **Place Waste Items**: Place waste items in the designated input area.
2. **Automatic Sorting**:
   - The vision sensor captures images of the waste materials.
   - The machine learning model determines the type of waste.
   - The robotic arm picks up the waste and places it in the appropriate bin.
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Use the user interface to monitor the sorting process and view real-time information about sorted waste materials.

### Monitoring and Control
- **User Interface**: Access the user interface via a computer or display to initiate, pause, and monitor the sorting process.
- **Error Notifications**: If an error is detected, the system will display an error message. Follow the on-screen instructions to resolve any issues.
